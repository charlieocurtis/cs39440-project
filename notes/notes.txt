Evaluations for analysis:
- Pearsons Correlation Coefficient
- T-Test

Prelim Experimentation:
First sample image onverted from PNG to JPG using PILLOW - Size dropped from ~1.2mil bytes to ~217k bytes using RGB conversion, however with greyscale conversion
(since image is greyscale) dropped further to ~212k bytes, MSE for original PNG and this version of the JPG was 106.72708225250244.
