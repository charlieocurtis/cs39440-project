Evaluations for analysis:
- Pearsons Correlation Coefficient (graphs of time vs size reduction/quality vs size reduction) - to do
- two sample T-Test (95% confidence) - to do
- Box plots for both J2k and BPE data (sizes/times) - done
- Avg Quality score (all three algos) - done
- Avg change in size - done
- Avg time taken to compress - done
- Standard deviations - done
- Absoltue Error Maps for certain "interesting cases" - ongoing


Prelim Experimentation:
First sample image onverted from PNG to JPG using PILLOW - Size dropped from ~1.2mil bytes to ~217k bytes using RGB conversion, however with greyscale conversion
(since image is greyscale) dropped further to ~212k (~17% original size) bytes, MSE for original PNG and this version of the JPG was 106.72708225250244.

Notes on demo:
- Introduce project
  - Background
  - Goal
- IQAAs
  - Classification of algorithms
    - Traits of such classifications
  - Discuss the basic control algorithms
  - Discuss the possibility of incorporating more advanced methods
- Talk about doing comparisons and trying to present the results of the investigation
- Show what happens for PNG to JPG conversion
  - Create compartive images for various image conversions
  
  PROJECT CHANGE:
  =======================================================================================================================================================
  
  OpenJPEG compression ratio limit 9000
  Need to find how to lossy compress to stop decompression creating image with reduced size
