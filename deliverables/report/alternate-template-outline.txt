- Background/Analysis/Process
	This will most likely be as per the original report template

- Method
	Original template talks about the method of some 'experiment' that is performed however, 
	this doesn't fit the scope of this project so most likely discuss:
		- Briefly talk about the subjective study (obviously referencing the document that was sent to me)
		- What sort of numerical analysis has been chosen and why
		- How the process of numerical analysis was conducted
		- Maybe also discuss the creation of the script I am using here, although might be better suited
		to somewhere else in the report??
- Results
	Demonstrate findings, visualising data (graphs, tables, images, etc.)

- Analysis
	Discuss what the results mean, what they tell us, how this might relate back to PanCam
	also any problems with the whole process, things that may be improved (specifically in the context of the process -
	improvements that may be made to the execution of the research. Improvements that may be made when discussing
	in the context of a final year project/as part of the CS39440 module, will come under critical evaluation)
	Finally, routes/avenues for further investigation that could build from this research

- Critical Evaluation
	Evaluation in the context of the final year project as previously mentioned

- References
	As per the original template

- Appendices
