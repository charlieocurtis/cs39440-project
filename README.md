Reasons for the use of CCSDS 122.0-B-2 Compression Standard in Space Missions over other Compression Methods

The project aims to seek reasoning for the use of one particular image compression standard in space missions, namely the CCSDS 122.0-B-2 standard.
Through the comparison of prexisting compression methodologies and the aforementioned it is the aim of the project to develop as comprehensive an analysis as possible to justify the use of the CCSDS standard.

### Research Question:
Given the quality of compressed images, what reasons are there for the use of the CCSDS 122.0-B-2 compression standard on PanCam, and why are other image
compression algorithms not used in the context of interplanetary communication?

### Sample Images:
