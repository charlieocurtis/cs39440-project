> Comparing image quality assessment algorithms with human perception for optimising image compression for ExoMars

A study into the differences and/or limitations of Image Quality Assessment algorithms, when compared to human perception in order to try and establish what level
of compression is most suitable for ExoMars images.

The purpose of this project is to compare the results of a human study into subjective quality assessment by humans with standard Image Quality Assessment (IQA) algorithms on a subset of images, ultimately to try and find an optimal level of compression that minimises the amount of data being sent/received, whilst maintaining the useability of the images. This is likely to be done through, initially a large amount and sustained process of researching relevant pieces of literature to better understand; what IQA algorithms are available, how these IQA algorithms work, and the standard of results produced by these algorithms, the next stage will be to conduct some numerical and statistical analysis of both the human study and sample images run through a selection of IQA algorithms in order to compare them against each other and try to reach the answer to the question of how much compression is suitable for the different functions that the camera system will be performing.
